# Inverse Kinematics

Animating the right arm of a skeletal rig using two different Inverse Kinematics methods; Cyclic Coordinate Descent and Jacobian. This program is written in C++.

## Project Highlights

To see the a project overview and to dive into the math, check out [Inverse Kinematics](http://joshpatel.ca/inverse_kinematics) at my portfolio [JoshPatel.ca](http://joshpatel.ca/).
